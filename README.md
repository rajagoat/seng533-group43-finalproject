# SENG 533 W2025 - Group 43 Final Project Repo

This repository contains source code, test scripts, raw measurement data, and generated performance plots used for our term project.

## Downloading raw data

Since some of the raw data files are larger than the GitHub 100MB file size, we used [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) to store them. This means if you wish to download it, you'll need to first install Git LFS, follow the initialization steps on the website, then clone the repo.
